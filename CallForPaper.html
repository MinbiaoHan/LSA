									<p>
										Please adhere to the following instructions when submitting:
										<ul>
											<li>Deanonymize your submission by replacing the <code>\documentclass[sigconf,anonymous]{aamas}<\code> command with the <code>\documentclass[sigconf]{aamas}</code> command.</li>
											<li>Every final submission must include an abstract section and keywords (separated by semicolon).</li>
											<!--<li>Download and use an updated version of aamas.cls found <a href="assets/aamas.cls">here</a>. </li>-->
											<li>Make sure there are no headers or footers (so do not remove the command <code>\fancyhead{}</code>).</li>
											<li>Every final submission must include an abstract section and keywords (separated by semicolon).</li>
											<li>Replace the copyright block in the AAMAS template with the following: <br>
												<code>
												\setcopyright{none}
												\acmConference[LSA'22]{Appears at the 1st Workshop on Learning with Strategic Agents (LSA 2022). Held as part of the Workshops at the 21st
